# Interviewing at QB
We're excited that you're considering joining QB engineering. This repo is for our candidate exercises. The goal of all the exercises is for it to be a conversation starter for you to get to know your future team mates. It is a take home assignment, and you should spend no more than a few hours on it. It is not meant to be production ready code, it is meant to serve as a way of illustrating the way you think about problem solving.
